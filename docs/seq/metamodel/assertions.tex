\Cref{fig:seq-metamodel-assertions} depicts the part of the metamodel concerning
sequence assertions.

A \msequenceproperty{} is an assertion about a particular \msequence{} with
respect to its \mtarget.  The \mtarget{} is modified by applying an
assertion-level \mtargetinstantiation, which may fix any constants not bound
by the sequence-level instantiation.  (The default is an empty instantiation,
meaning the target is exactly as specified at the sequence level.)

The specific sequence assertion type comes from the \msequencepropertytype:
either `sequence holds on target' (refinement), or `sequence is observed on
target' (reverse refinement).  The assertion can be negated.  The choice of
\mcspmodel{} affects how the assertion is checked with CSP tools such as FDR
\todo{the models aren't actually used yet; everything is treated as untimed
traces refinement.  This will change.}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=Example]
assertion A: SequenceName holds           // positive 'holds' SequenceAssertion
assertion B: SequenceName does not hold   // negative 'holds' SequenceAssertion
assertion C: SequenceName is observed     // positive 'is observed' SequenceAssertion
assertion D: SequenceName is not observed // negative 'is observed' SequenceAssertion

assertion E: SequenceName holds with { CONSTANT set to 5 }
// example of SequenceAssertion with custom TargetInstantiation
