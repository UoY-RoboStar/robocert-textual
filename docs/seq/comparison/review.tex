This section reviews each of the above notations in turn, comparing
\langname{} sequences to each.

\subsection{UML 2.0}

\paragraph{Timing features}
UML sequence diagrams have support for \emph{time constraints} (applied to one
moment on the lifeline) and \emph{duration constraints} (applied across part
of a lifeline). \todo{visual-paradigm tutorials; need a proper citation.}
These can specify concepts such as `noting that a message arrives at time
\(t_1\) and its reply arrives at time \(t_2\), the duration \(t_2 - t_1 < 1\) seconds'.
We take the basic duration constraint from UML as the graphical
notation for our notion of \mdeadlinestep s.

\paragraph{Semantics}
Our semantics (\cref{sec:semantics-tockcsp-seq}) takes heavy inspiration from
that of Lima et al.~\cite{lima-semantics}, with minor differences to account
for the fact that we target \tockcsp{} and not Compass CML.  In the case of
two-\mactor{} sequences \todo{all of them at the moment}, we can (and do)
simplify the semantics significantly.
The main novelty of our work here is that, by targeting \tockcsp, we can capture
timing properties.

\subsection{MARTE}

\paragraph{Timing features}
MARTE supports a range of timing models, including discrete-time (clocked) and
continuous-time (real-time) approaches; our work only covers discrete-time
situations.\todo{cite this, I can't remember where I saw it}

MARTE has rich support, using its \emph{Value Specification Language}, for
constraining the durations of message-passing as well as parts of lifelines,
allowing constraints at both local
and global scope\todo{Getting this from Ebeid et al, but I'm not sure that's the
right citation}.  We do not yet support this level of richness.

\paragraph{Semantics}
We are not aware of a particular formal semantics for the MARTE profile.
\todo{Check}
There is work to generate HDL from MARTE sequence diagrams~\todo{cite}

\subsection{Property Sequence Chart}

\paragraph{Semantics}
The PSC semantics is in terms of B\"uchi automata, and automated as a
\textsc{Charmy} plugin.

\subsection{Timed Property Sequence Chart}
This notation extends property sequence charts to add 

\paragraph{Timing features}

\paragraph{Semantics}
The TPSC semantics is in terms of timed B\"uchi automata.
