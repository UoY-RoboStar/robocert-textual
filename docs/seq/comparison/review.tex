This section reviews each of the above notations in turn, comparing
\langname{} sequences to each.

\subsection{UML 2.5.1 sequence diagrams}

UML sequence diagrams are a well-understood, standardised notation for
specifying properties over sequences of multi-actor interactions.  As such, they
are an obvious first point of inspiration and comparison.  We track the most
recent standard at time of writing (2.5.1) here.

\paragraph{Timing features}
UML 2.5.1 dedicates section 8.4 to basic notions of time.  This
support comes in \emph{time} and \emph{duration} (difference between two points
in time) primitives, further divided into \emph{observations} (inspecting the
moment in time when, or duration since, some event occurred) as well as
\emph{constraints} (specifying the time or duration of one or more events).
Constraints can to refer to observations, allowing complex situations such as
`this set of events should happen in at most three times the duration that
this other set of events happened in'.  Duration constraints come in the
form of intervals between minimum and maximum permitted duration.

At the moment, our \mdeadlinestep{} construct resembles a UML duration
constraint with minimum duration \(0\).  We do not support observations.

\paragraph{Semantics}
Our semantics (\cref{sec:semantics-tockcsp-seq}) takes heavy inspiration from
that of Lima et al.~\cite{lima-semantics}, with minor differences to account
for the fact that we target \tockcsp{} and not Compass CML.  In the case of
two-\mactor{} sequences \todo{all of them at the moment}, we can (and do)
simplify the semantics significantly.
The main novelty of our work here is that, by targeting \tockcsp, we can capture
timing properties.

\subsection{MARTE}

MARTE is a UML profile for real-time systems.

\paragraph{Timing features}
MARTE supports a range of timing models, including discrete-time (clocked) and
continuous-time (real-time) approaches; our work only covers discrete-time
situations.\todo{cite this, I can't remember where I saw it}

MARTE has rich support, using its \emph{Value Specification Language}, for
constraining the durations of message-passing as well as parts of lifelines,
allowing constraints at both local
and global scope\todo{Getting this from Ebeid et al, but I'm not sure that's the
right citation}.  We do not yet support this level of richness.

\paragraph{Semantics}
We are not aware of a particular formal semantics for the MARTE profile.
\todo{Check}
There is work to generate HDL from MARTE sequence diagrams~\todo{cite}

\subsection{Property Sequence Chart}


\paragraph{Timing features}
None.

\paragraph{Probabilistic features}
None.

\paragraph{Semantics}
The PSC semantics is in terms of B\"uchi automata, and automated as a
\textsc{Charmy} plugin.

\subsection{Timed Property Sequence Chart}
This notation extends property sequence charts to add 

\paragraph{Timing features}

\paragraph{Probabilistic features}
None.

\paragraph{Semantics}
The TPSC semantics is in terms of timed B\"uchi automata.

\subsection{Probabilistic Timed Property Sequence Chart}
This notation extends timed property sequence charts to add probabilistic
sections.

\paragraph{Timing features}
As above.

\subsection{Property Specification Patterns}

\subsection{Autili, Grunske, Lumpe, Pelliccione, and Tang}

This work proposes a structured English grammar covering many of the Property
Specification Patterns.  The grammar provides for timing and probabilistic
features.
