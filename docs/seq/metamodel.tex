This chapter discusses the metamodel of \langname{} sequences.  This metamodel
has multiple concrete notations ---
the \emph{textual} (\cref{cha:seq-textual}) and \emph{graphical}
syntax (\cref{cha:seq-graphical}) --- and a semantics (\cref{cha:semantics-intro}). 

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:metamodel-intro}

For information on how to read the rest of this chapter, see the notes on
the top-level metamodel (\cref{ssec:core-metamodel-intro-readme}).

\subsection{A note on ordering and timing}\label{ssec:metamodel-intro-ordering}

By default, \langname{} sequences are \emph{explicit}
as to \emph{which} actions occur, but \emph{implicit} as to
\emph{when}.

Unless modified by gaps,
communications on \langname{} sequences are strictly ordered with
respect to each other and permit no intervening communications.  This
reflects the view of sequence diagrams as representations of traces of
the system under test, and appears consistent with some semantic
treatments of UML~\cite{lima-semantics}.  \todo{needs more
  justification?  is the point about Lima's semantics correct?}

Like \robochart, \langname{} has a discrete-time model, where time is
measured in \emph{time units} and events, operation calls, and
primitive data operations (assignments, communication, and so on) are
instantaneous.  Time cn pass when the software is waiting for an
interaction with the platform.  Accordingly, any amount of time may
pass in a sequence, unless constrained by \mdeadlinestep s
(\cref{ssec:metamodel-steps-deadlines}).
