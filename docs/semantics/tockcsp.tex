This section introduces a \tockcsp{} semantics for \langname.
The behaviour of the \langname{} generator is expected to conform to
this semantics, except that:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  The generator targets \cspm{} instead of CSP, and so \emph{may}
  use semantically equivalent \cspm{} constructs where the CSP equivalents
  are missing or not idiomatic;
\item
  The generator \emph{must} wrap processes in
  timed sections and prioritisations to achieve the appropriate \tockcsp{} behaviours of
  CSP operators;
\item
  The generator \emph{may} perform semantics-preserving optimisations,
  such as substituting \(P\) for \(\tlang{\Stop \interrupt \olang{P}}\).
\end{itemize}

\todo{Some of the definitions are very loosely typed (as they are expanding from
a metamodel to textual snippets of something halfway between \tockcsp{} and
\cspm), and it'd be nice to fix that and/or give explicit result types.}
