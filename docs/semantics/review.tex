This chapter reviews known formal semantic treatments for any notations
mentioned earlier as similar to those in \langname, and compares them to
our approaches.

\section{Sequences}\label{sec:semantics-review-seq}

\subsection{UML2 and derived profiles}

\paragraph{CML semantics of SysML}

Our semantics (\cref{sec:semantics-tockcsp-seq}) takes heavy inspiration from
that of Lima et al.~\cite{lima-semantics} on the SysML profile of UML, with
some differences to account for a retargeting from CML to \tockcsp.  For
two-\mactor{} sequences \todo{all of them at the moment}, we can (and do)
simplify the semantics significantly.
The main novelty of our work here is that, by targeting \tockcsp, we can capture
timing properties and refinement relations.

\paragraph{MARTE}

We are not aware of a particular formal semantics for the MARTE profile.
\todo{Check}
There is work to generate HDL from MARTE sequence diagrams~\todo{cite}

\paragraph{Trace semantics of STAIRS}

STAIRS~\cite{Haugen03-STAIRS} gives a trace semantics for UML2 in terms
of pairs of positive and negative trace sets.  These traces contain
transmission and consumption events across signals.

Traces for timed
STAIRS~\cite{Haugen05-TimedSTAIRS} also contain separate reception
events (capturing the distinction between the time an event reaches
its destination and the time it is processed), and \(\mathbb R\)-valued
timestamps capturing timing.

\subsection{PSC, TPSC, and PTPSC}

Property Sequence Chart (and its derivatives) is a layer atop
linear temporal logic, which means that its operational semantics is
in the form of B\"uchi automata (for TPSC, timed B\"uchi
automata; it is unclear what needs to be added to these automata for PTPSC \todo{?}).

For PSC, a \textsc{Charmy} plugin automates the operational semantics.  A denotational semantics in terms of
invalid traces also exists.
