  abstract =	 {Property Sequence Chart (PSC) is a novel
                  scenario-based notation, which has been recently
                  proposed to represent temporal properties of
                  concurrent systems. This language balances
                  expressive power and simplicity of use. However, the
                  current version of PSC just represents the order of
                  events and lacks the ability to express timing
                  properties. In real-time systems, it is well known
                  that these timing requirements are very important
                  and need to be specified clearly. Thus, in this
                  paper, we define timed PSC (TPSC) and give the
                  semantics of TPSC in terms of Timed BÃ¼chi Automaton
                  (TBA). Then, we measure the expressive power of TPSC
                  based on the recently proposed real-time
                  specification patterns. Finally, we illustrate the
                  use of TPSC in the context of a web service
                  application which requires timing requirements.}
