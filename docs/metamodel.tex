We define \langname{} in the form of a formal abstract syntax (or
metamodel) which is representable in multiple concrete notations ---
the \emph{textual} (\cref{cha:textual}) and \emph{graphical}
syntax (\cref{cha:graphical}) --- and which has a semantics in terms
of process algebras and other formalisms (\cref{cha:semantics}).  This
chapter discusses the abstract syntax and, in turn, the key concepts
of \langname.

\section{Introduction}\label{sec:metamodel-intro}

\subsection{A note on ordering and timing}\label{sec:metamodel-intro-ordering}

Actions on \langname{} sequence diagrams are, by default, strictly
ordered with respect to each other and permit no intervening
communications.  This reflects the view of sequence diagrams as
representations of traces of the system under test, and appears
consistent with some semantic treatments of UML~\cite{lima-semantics}.
\todo{needs more justification?  is the point about Lima's semantics
  correct?}

\langname{} has native support for the \robochart{} timing model.
This model assumes a discrete notion of time measured in \emph{time
  units} such that, while actions such as events and operations are
instantaneous, time is allowed to pass in between them.  Many
\robochart{} timing primitives have counterparts in \langname.

To summarise, \langname{} sequences default to being \emph{explicit}
as to \emph{which} communications occur, but \emph{implicit} as to
\emph{when} they occur.

\subsection{How to read the rest of this chapter}\label{ssec:metamodel-intro-readme}

Each section, except this one and \cref{sec:metamodel-features},
introduces a group of related \langname{}
functionality in a top-down manner.  These sections contain:

\begin{itemize}
\item
	a class diagram representing the Ecore classes, enumerations, and other
	components that make up the group being discussed;
\item
	descriptions of the components being shown in the class diagram;
\item
	where relevant, examples of the components in terms of the concrete
	syntaxes of \langname.
\end{itemize}
