We define \langname{} by defining its
metamodel.  Parts of the metamodel map to various concrete notations (for
instance, sequences map to UML-style sequence diagrams), and have a semantics
in terms of process algebras and other formalisms (\cref{cha:semantics-intro}).

This chapter discusses the top-level metamodel and, in turn, the key concepts
of \langname.

\section{Introduction}\label{ssec:core-metamodel-intro}
\subsection{How to read the rest of this chapter}\label{ssec:core-metamodel-intro-readme}

Each section, except this one,
introduces a group of top-level \langname{}
functionality in a top-down manner.  These sections contain:

\begin{itemize}
\item
	a class diagram representing the Ecore classes, enumerations, and other
	components that make up the group being discussed;
\item
	descriptions of the components being shown in the class diagram;
\item
	where relevant, examples of the components in terms of the concrete
	syntaxes of \langname.
\end{itemize}
