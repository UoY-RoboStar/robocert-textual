# The RoboCert (prototype) Model

This subproject contains the EMF metamodel for RoboCert.  It is structured as
follows:

- `model/` contains the main metamodel artefacts.  The authoritative form of
  the metamodel is the Emfatic (`RoboCert.emf`) file.  Please regenerate the
  Ecore (`RoboCert.ecore`) from this after editing.
- `src-gen/` contains, or will contain, the source generated by
  `RoboCert.genmodel`.
- `src/` contains Xtend source for custom overrides to the source in `src-gen/`.
  These usually appear when there are derived members in the model.
  If adding new overrides, remember to register them in `RoboCertFactoryImplCustom`.
