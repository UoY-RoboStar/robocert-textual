# Unreleased

## 2022-02-11

- Changed scoping rules to allow enumerations to be scoped properly.
- Added `use enum package::EnumName` to pull enumerations into scope, so
  as to avoid the fact that in RoboChart expressions `package::EnumName::X`
  would be parsed as an enumeration `package`.

# 0.1.0

Initial release.
