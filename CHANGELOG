# 0.2.0 (unreleased)

## Breaking changes

This version greatly and incompatibly changes the top-level syntax of
RoboCert to align closer to the other RoboStar textual languages.  In
specific:

- whitespace is no longer significant;
- `group`s and `sequence`s now require opening and closing braces for
  block delimiting (the interior of sequences still use Mermaid-style
  syntax and therefore do not use braces);
- the use of `:` to denote a one-liner combined fragment in sequences
  has been abolished, and should be replaced with an `end` at the end of
  the line instead;
- any use of `:` in branch fragments should be removed without replacement.
- `deadline (X units) on Y` is now `deadline (X units on Y)`;
- `deadlock on Y` is now `deadlock (on Y)`, for consistency.

## Features

- Added `use enum package::EnumName` to pull enumerations into scope, so
  as to avoid the fact that in RoboChart expressions `package::EnumName::X`
  would be parsed as an enumeration `package`.
- The word `set` may now be omitted in a reference to a message set (but not
  a definition of one).  For instance, `any except SetName until deadlock end`
  is now legal.  The valid forms are `message set`, `set`, or no keyword.
- `specification group`s may now be called `property group`s.  The latter term
  is preferred and may become the sole valid name in future versions.

## Fixes

- Changed scoping rules to allow enumerations to be scoped properly.
- Expression generator now emits enumerations properly.
